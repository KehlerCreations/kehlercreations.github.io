            <p class="information">My most important project. Through developing A-Star Theft, I have learned all disciplines of game development: Including design, programming, graphics, audio and writing.
                <br><br>
                2024 marks my 10 year aniversary of game development, and of this game. While A-Star Theft is technically not my first project, it is the one that I have stood by for a decade.
