            <p class="information">I like to think of my self as a free-spirited game designer, where no idea is off limits - it is all about proper implementation.</p>
            <p class="information">Over the course of over nine years, I have been working on A-STAR THEFT. It is through this game that most of my practical skills have been forged.
                <br>On this page, you will discover what choices I made when developing the game.

                            <li>Players can use the environment to their advantage. This may be by dodging bullets, destroying a wall, blocking off a path, or trapping their enemies in toxic gas.</li>
                            <li>Combat is almost weightless, but in the best possible way. Quick motions and fast reaction times are fundamental to the chaotic fighting experience.</li>

                            <li>Characters are deliberately positioned to play a role in the puzzle design. A set of NPCs in the environment provide a challenge. One may choose to be clever, or to be a brute, when tackling these obstacles.</li>
                            <li>Players can manipulate the environment to alter the puzzles. Every wall is destructible, distactions can be used, and NPCs are affected by the time of day.</li>

                            <li>The primary narrative experience is created by segments of story in between missions. This enables the levels themselves to be as unrestricted as possible.</li>
                            <li>Your friends will often talk to you both on- and off-mission to establish lore, character, and (hopefully) a sense of humor.</li>
                            <li>Missions are designed to represent the hot and arid city of San Dinero. A sprawling world has been created for the game, filled with history and characters.</li>

                            <li>I utilize an advanced lighting engine to create day and night time, altering both the visual style and NPC behavior.</li>
                            <li>My goal has been to create an appropriate art style to faciliate storytelling and gameplay clarity. When realism is forgone, personality can flourish.</li>

                            <li>The music is comprised of a large amount of tracks in various genres. This helps setting the proper tone of map. Certain missions also have specially tailored music.</li>
                            <li>The music has been remastered over time, to always be up to date with my more recently developed skills.</li>
