                <p>
                    I am Elliot Kehler, an independent game developer, writer, and music producer. My primary focus today lies on the remake of my beloved project A-Star Theft.
                    As a generalist creative individual, I have found that my specialty does not lie in any specific discipline or topic,
                    but rather in the art of merging these discrete components to intuitively come together in a larger whole.

                <h1 class="section-heading">My history</h1>
                <p>
                    My first tip-toeing into game development started in early 2014, when I discovered YoYoGames' GameMaker 8.1,
                    with which I promply began the creation of the beautiful masterpiece once known as <span class="presentation-information-highlight">Bob vs Bert</span>. I hope to someday rediscover pictures of this eighth wonder of the world.
                    My friend and I worked on this project as wee-little 13 year old boys. It was incredible to actually make something ourselves, as we had envisioned years before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few months of experimentation and making <span class="presentation-information-highlight">crude adaptations</span> of other media such as Grand Theft Auto V, it was time to do something a bit bigger. I began building a <span class="presentation-information-highlight">"faithful" recreation</span> of my favorite game at the time - Payday 2.
                    For the next 6 years, this would become the focus of my life. From 7th grade to graduating upper secondary school, through hardship and mental devestation, on this one thing I never gave up. Friday August 28 2020, a mere weekend before beginning my years of college,
                    <br><span class="presentation-information-highlight">A-STAR THEFT</span> was released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite a commercial failure, it was a tremendous personal success. The first review came in - "What a fun game."
                    This made all the effort worth it.
