                    I am Elliot Kehler.
                    <br>
                    Independet game developer, writer, and music producer. My primary focus lies today on continued support for A-Star Theft.
                    <br><br>
                    As a generalist creative individual, I have found that my specialty lies in figuring out how discrete components intuitively come together in a larger whole.

            <div class="personal-presentation">
                <p class="information">
                    My first tip-toeing into game development started in early 2014, when I discovered YoYoGames' GameMaker 8.1,
                    with which I promply began the creation of the beautiful masterpiece once known as <span class="presentation-information-highlight">Bob vs Bert</span>. I hope to someday rediscover pictures of this eighth wonder of the world.
                    <br><br>
                    After a few months of experimentation and making crude adaptations of other media such as <span class="presentation-information-highlight">Grand Theft Auto V</span>, I started to build a "faithful" recreation of my favorite game at the time - <span class="presentation-information-highlight">Payday 2</span>.
